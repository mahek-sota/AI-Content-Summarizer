## AI Content Summarizer

This FastAPI-based backend application leverages large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4 to generate high-quality summaries from long-form text content such as articles, essays, or reports. It supports different summarization styles—brief, detailed, or bullet-point—and includes a built-in summary history system to store and retrieve past results with timestamps and metadata. The API is optimized for chunking large inputs and can be easily extended to include URL scraping, audio summaries, or user-specific history.
